Hey there,

Glad you opened this up, unless its Favio reading, then fuck you :P

Anyways, the way to use this installer is to make sure the folder that the installer is stored in is called:

"Installer"

If it is not called Installer, then the program WILL NOT WORK. Period.


It may look like there is nothing in this folder other than the Ez Installer, and you would be half right.
I have hidden all of the other files, for convenience sakes. If you are intereted in looking around to make sure there aren't any creepy crawlies then go ahead,
Everything you need to run the installer is included with the installer.

If you have any questions reach out and I'll help you out.


Thanks for saving me the time of explaining how to install all this shit. It took me WAY longer to fucking make this thing so you better apprecaite how FUCKING ez
it is to use, cuz it was a bitch to make. PEEERRRRIOOOD.. SEE YOU SOON BITCH BOY
